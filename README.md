# bfig (WIP)

This is a simple package to generate the Brownerd Figlet.

## Usage
1. install this package
2. Run `npm install` from the package
2. Grab the [Brownerd Figlet](https://github.com/brownerd/brownerd-fig) and install it insidet he Figlet node_module in the font folder.

At the moment, this is just for fun. I might make this less messy to install.
